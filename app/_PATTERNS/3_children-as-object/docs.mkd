This hierarchy component expects an object that matches the `IMyObject` interface to be passed as its child:

```ts
interface IMyObject {
  /** Name of child within hierarchy */
  name: string;
  /** Nested children within hierarchy */
  children: IMyObject[];
}
```

The `Hierarchy` component recursively renders any children that match the `IMyObject` interface using a **type-guard**. The `Toggle` component is used to enable expand/collapse functionality for each hierarchy level.
